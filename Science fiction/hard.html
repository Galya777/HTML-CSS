<h1>Hard science fiction</h1>
<p>Hard science fiction is characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell's Islands of Space in Astounding Science Fiction.[24][25][26] The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction,[27] first appeared in the late 1970s; referring to the popular distinction between the "hard" (natural) and "soft" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.</p>
